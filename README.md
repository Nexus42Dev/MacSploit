Hello!
Welcome to the macsploit source code repo- note this was not released for learning.
A lot of the code was bad at the time I released this, but of course you are welcome to try decipher it.
The reason I released this was only to combat people sneakily sharing the leaked source code of macsploit, and turning it into a big problem.
The code was already out there, so I thought i'd release it properly to at least give people a chance to see how macsploit works :D
